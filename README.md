We thank all the authors who made their stable carbon isotope data of plant materials available through published compilations. A.L. was supported by a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant agreement no: 838739 ECAW-ISO). This research is a contribution to the AXA Chair Programme in Biosphere and Climate Impacts and the Imperial College initiative on Grand Challenges in Ecosystems and the Environment. The project has also received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant agreement no: 787203 REALM). We greatly thank the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (San Diego, CA, USA) and the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (Boulder, CO, USA) for making stable carbon isotope data of atmospheric CO2 gathered at different observational stations across the globe available through their websites. The CarbonTracker CT2019 results data were also provided by NOAA ESRL.
